# used_car_price

This repository contains the end-to-end implementation for predicting used car price in the USA. This project is in 
active mode, so I keep experimenting ideas in notebook (in notebooks folder). I got the dataset from here on kaggle 
dataset page https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data. Here are the words from the author of the 
data creator. ```Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's very difficult to 
collect all of them in the same place. I built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create 
this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.```

I have taken the data collected from the author and tried to implement it end-to-end with MLOps. 

These are the steps I have performed:

1: Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Feature Selection
5. Model building
6. Model deployment using Streamlit 
7. Setup CI/CD for training automation
8. Data and model versioning using DVC
